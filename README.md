<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Kopimon is a Singapore-themed role-playing game with pixelised art and multiplayer capailities. Inspired by the original Pokemon game commonly found on the Gameboy consoles, we wanted to create a game that is relevant and relatable to Singaporeans of all age groups regardless of their differences. A game that is easy to understand, and easy on the eye for that purpose. We also want to instil a sense of local pride or wonder at the unique elements that Singapore possesses.
