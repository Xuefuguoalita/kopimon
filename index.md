## Welcome to Kopimon's Github Wiki

Kopimon is a pixelised, Singapore-themed, role-playing game with multiplayer capabilities. 

What is the aim of this game? It's simple, we promise! You start with a starter kopimon, and explore the world around. As you walk around, you will be handed quests by non-player characters (NPCs) which will lead to rewards and other locations being unlocked. Fight other wild enemy kopimons, defeat them and emerge victorious as you level up. Are you willing to do what it takes to save the world of Kopimon from the pandemic?

## Background and Motivation

Pokemon is the app that the first version was based off of, a simple tile-based pixel game that has lasted many decades. This led us to be curious about why this was so, and we were intrigued to know why such a simple game was so widely popular, bridging across generations. We were curious to see if we could recreate a similar game with simple-looking functions that are actually not easy to code and design. 


## Objectives

Creating a game that is relevant and relatable to Singaporeans of all age groups regardless of their differences. Game has to be simple and easy to understand, and easy on the eye for that purpose. We wanted to instil a sense of local pride or wonder at the unique elements that Singapore possesses.


## Review of Literature/Technology

“Pencils, Paints, or Pixels?: How Aesthetic Choices of Indie Games Affect Interactive Experience” by Gonzalo Alvarez (Lamar University) - talks about how indie games (i.e. pixel art and hand drawn stuff) survive in today’s world, despite the release of games with newer technologies such as photorealistic graphics and smooth animation. On pixel art specifically, the author mentioned that there is a sense of nostalgia when such an art style is used.

This study explores the psychological effects and benefits of past-related gaming, which considers storylines, graphics, and other aspects of games which might invoke nostalgia in the user. It was found that past memories more strongly associated with enjoyment and challenge, https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-48742-001 - study of the psychological effects and benefits of past-related gaming, it was found that past memories more strongly associated with enjoyment and challenge (basically makes people feel more strongly) and social memories are more likely to involve close others 

This nostalgia, coupled with the pride of Singapore and its elements, can appeal to our target audience’s pathos. 



## Design & Implementation

**Design considerations/choice of components**

Previous designs:
We felt that there were too many use-cases, which could distract us from 
Cut down on the choice of components to focus on a game on itself without other distractions or unnecessary elements. This allows us to zero in on what we found important, which was invoking a sense of pride 
We decided to use Unity - game engine - real time, cross-platform support, collaborative, C++ as we were planning to create a working game at the end of it. Unity also provides a high level of flexibility and modifiability in terms of the design and art.
