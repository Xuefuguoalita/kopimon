## Welcome to Kopimón's Github Wiki

Kopimon is a pixelised, Singapore-themed, role-playing game with multiplayer capabilities. 

What is the aim of this game? It's simple, we promise! You start with a starter kopimon, and explore the world around. As you walk around, you will be handed quests by non-player characters (NPCs) which will lead to rewards and other locations being unlocked. Fight other wild enemy kopimons, defeat them and emerge victorious as you level up. Are you willing to do what it takes to save the world of Kopimon from the pandemic?

## Background and Motivation

Gathertown was a widely used platform that offered a virtual space and meeting room, especially during remote working and socialising during the COVID-19 pandemic. The platform was welcomed by many communities around the world as it created opportunities of conferencing and socialising during a time when many did not think such forms of human interaction were possible. It made the best out of a difficult time where face-to-face interactions were difficult.

Another application which caught our attention was Pokemon. Pokemon is the app that the first version was based off of, a simple tile-based pixel game that has lasted many decades. This led us to be curious about why this was so, and we were intrigued to know why such a simple game was so widely popular, bridging across generations. We were curious to see if we could recreate a similar game with simple-looking functions that are actually not easy to code and design.



## Objectives

Create an application or software that best emulates the experience that Gathertown created during the pandemic. The application we would like to use is a game - relevant and relatable to Singaporeans of all age groups regardless of their differences. Game has to be simple and easy to understand, and easy on the eye for that purpose. We want to instil a sense of local pride or wonder at the unique elements that Singapore possesses. Highlighting the diverse melting pot of cultures and diversity in nature in Singapore. Emphasise on both the underappreciated aspects of Singapore as well (views-wise) and popular tourist attractions (world class, globally-renowned) 



## Review of Literature/Technology

“Pencils, Paints, or Pixels?: How Aesthetic Choices of Indie Games Affect Interactive Experience” by Gonzalo Alvarez (Lamar University) - talks about how indie games (i.e. pixel art and hand drawn stuff) survive in today’s world, despite the release of games with newer technologies such as photorealistic graphics and smooth animation. On pixel art specifically, the author mentioned that there is a sense of nostalgia when such an art style is used. It is said that the classics of video games are built on pixel art. In the early beginnings of the game history, most games were made using pixel art and thus there is a strong relationship between nostalgia and the old-school gaming vibe which triggers the good old memories. Games such as Super Mario Bros, Super Metroid and Final Fantasy IV are few successes to mention. As time passed, less and less people would have lived in the early era of video games and are exposed to more advanced technology such as 3D graphics or virtual reality. Nostalgia would be less of an influence to entice gamers to play pixel-art games. Born from hardware limitations, pixel art has now instead become an artistic choice to build a certain atmosphere of the game scene and bring an unique aesthetic to the game. The Last Night by the Odd Tales is one such games that had a breakthrough by creating cinematics visuals with pixel art. As pokemon was first released in 1996, and is still highly raved, we want to bring back this nostalgic game to many but more relatable in the Singapore context and referencing it to today’s current affairs -- Covid’19 situation. https://pin.it/2RPKqav

This study explores the psychological effects and benefits of past-related gaming, which considers storylines, graphics, and other aspects of games which might invoke nostalgia in the user. It was found that past memories are more strongly associated with stronger emotions, on both the enjoyment and challenge ends of the spectrums. Social memories are more https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-48742-001 - study of the psychological effects and benefits of past-related gaming, it was found that past memories more strongly associated with enjoyment and challenge (basically makes people feel more strongly) and social memories are more likely to involve close others 


This nostalgia, coupled with the pride of Singapore and its elements, can appeal to our target audience’s pathos. 



## Design & Implementation

**Design considerations/choice of components**

Previous designs:
We felt that there were too many use cases, and decided to focus on one or two main elements to form a cohesive game that came together and served a specific purpose. This would allow our application to be more purposeful and for our design of both technical functionalities and artistic elements.
The decision to cut down on the quantity of components also allowed for a more specific cut down on the number of components to focus on a game on itself without other distractions or unnecessary elements. This allows us to zero in on what we found important, which was invoking a sense of pride.
We decided to use Unity game engine - real time, cross-platform support, collaborative, C++ - as we were planning to create a working game at the end of it. Unity also provides a high level of flexibility and modifiability in terms of the design and art. 



**Final Design**



**Discussion**




## Conclusion and Recommendation

Expansion of map, adding of more elements and animals, basically adding on to the bank of what we already have
Addition of features such as shops, collaborative party quests simulating other popular sentimental games. There can also be an added layer to the storyline, or added meaning to the items or other elements that already exist in the game.
