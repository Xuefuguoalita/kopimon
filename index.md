## Welcome to the Kopimon RPG's Github Website

Kopimon is a pixelised, Singapore-themed, role-playing game with multiplayer capabilities. 

What is the aim of this game? It's simple, we promise! You start with a starter kopimon, and explore the world around. As you walk around, you will be handed quests by non-player characters (NPCs) which will lead to rewards and other locations being unlocked. Fight other wild enemy kopimons, defeat them and emerge victorious as you level up. Are you willing to do what it takes to save the world of Kopimon from the pandemic?
