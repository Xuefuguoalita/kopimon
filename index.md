## Welcome to the Kopimon's Github Website

Kopimon is a pixelised, Singapore-themed, role-playing game with multiplayer capabilities. 

What is the aim of this game? It's simple, we promise! You start with a starter kopimon, and explore the world around. As you walk around, you will be handed quests by non-player characters (NPCs) which will lead to rewards and other locations being unlocked. Fight other wild enemy kopimons, defeat them and emerge victorious as you level up. Are you willing to do what it takes to save the world of Kopimon from the pandemic?

## Background and Motivation

Pokemon is the app that the first version was based off of, a simple tile-based pixel game that has lasted many decades. We were curious to see if we could recreate a similar game with deceivingly simple-looking functions that are actually not easy to code and design. Despite the simplicity of the game, it is a game which has bridged across generations and been a significant part of manyâ€™s lives growing up. 


## Objectives

Creating a game that is relevant and relatable to Singaporeans of all age groups regardless of their differences. Game has to be simple and easy to understand, and attractive to the eye for that purpose
